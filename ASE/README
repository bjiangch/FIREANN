reann.py is the codes to interface REANN with ase. If you want to use this interface, you need to copy the reann.py to Path/ase/calculators/ folder. we add the name "reann" and "'reann':'REANN'" to the name and special list located in line 128-137 of calculator.py	

***Very important thing***:
(1) Read the ase_reann.py to learn how to use this interface.

(2) When you use this interfance for multiprocessing, there is a error about can't pickle module objects.
Because the interfance loads the nn model as initial, and pytorch can't deepcopy and can't pickle module.
If you appear these problems, you need to cancel the nn model as initial in reann.py, and write the pes in other place, 
such as in the calculator, although the speed is slower.

ase_reann.py is the example how to use the ase with the eann and reann.
